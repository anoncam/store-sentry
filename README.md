# Store-Sentry

Store-Sentry is a serverless application that allows developers to manage access to in-app purchase content hosted on Cloudflare, based on App Store Server Notifications. The application is structured into two main components: `gatekeeper` and `listening-post`.

## Getting Started

Before setting up Store-Sentry, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- A Cloudflare account
- Access to the Apple App Store Server Notifications

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/store-sentry.git
```
2. Change the directory
```bash
cd store-sentry
```
3. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
4. Fill out the necessary environment variables in the `wrangler.toml` files in both `gatekeeper` and `listening-post` directories.

## Usage

Store-Sentry is divided into two components:

1. **gatekeeper**: This component is responsible for managing access to in-app purchase content. It controls the access to both public and premium content based on the user status stored in a key-value pair storage.

2. **listening-post**: This component listens for App Store Server Notifications and updates user access status in the key-value pair storage accordingly.

The two components are independent but work together to manage access to in-app purchase content.
